# End-to-end-ML-pipeline-with-scikit-learn
A comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline that efficiently handles data preprocessing, model training, and prediction on test/inference data. The pipeline automates the workflow from data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment, ensuring robust and scalable machine learning solutions. To demonstrate the pipeline operation, a simple example dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) was utilized. 

Pipeline was built by using Scikit-learn.

Run 'pipeline.py' to execute the pipeline
